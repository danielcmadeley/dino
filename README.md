# 🦖 Digital Dino - Where Code Meets Creativity

Welcome to the prehistoric playground of web development! Digital Dino isn't just another web agency - we're a pack of code-loving dinosaurs who turn digital dreams into roaring realities.

## 🌟 What Makes Us Extinct-ional

- 🎨 **Horizontal Scrolling Wonder**: Our landing page scrolls sideways (because dinosaurs don't believe in vertical limitations)
- 🦖 **Fossil Files**: Our tech knowledge base (where we store millions of years of dev wisdom)
- 📧 **Email That Doesn't Go Extinct**: Custom templates that survive any inbox
- 🎯 **Analytics That Dig Deep**: Like archaeological data, but for your website
- 💼 **Portfolio That Roars**: Showcasing our greatest discoveries
- 📱 **Responsive Like a Raptor**: Adapts faster than evolutionary theory

## 🛠️ Our Prehistoric Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (Because even dinosaurs need the latest tools)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Making our sites look prettier than a Pterodactyl)
- **Animations**:
  - Framer Motion (For smooth moves)
  - GSAP (Because dinosaurs love smooth scrolling)
- **Email**: React Email & Postmark (Faster than a Velociraptor)
- **Analytics**: PostHog & OpenPanel (Tracking better than a T-Rex)
- **Search**: Algolia (Finding things faster than a pack of Compys)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod (Validated like fossil carbon dating)
- **UI**: Radix UI primitives (As reliable as prehistoric rock formations)

## 🦕 Key Features

### The Fossil Files

Our pride and joy! A comprehensive collection of development tools and knowledge. Check out our extensive collections:

```typescript:src/app/(web-pages)/fossil-files/config/frontend-data.ts
startLine: 13
endLine: 63
```

### Fun Facts Engine

We've got a treasure trove of tech facts that would make even a Brachiosaurus' long neck spin:

```typescript:src/app/(web-pages)/fossil-files/config/frontend-facts.ts
startLine: 1
endLine: 52
```

## 🌿 Environment Setup

Before you start digging, create a `.env.local` file with these essentials:

```env
# Analytics (for tracking those footprints)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=your_posthog_host

# Email (for prehistoric communication)
POSTMARK_API_TOKEN=your_postmark_token
POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL=your_from_email

# Search (finding needles in prehistoric haystacks)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=your_algolia_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=your_algolia_search_key
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY=your_algolia_admin_key
```

## 🦖 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository (like extracting DNA from amber)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (gathering your tools)
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (awakening the beast)
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (your portal to the prehistoric web)

## 🌋 Deployment

We're optimized for Vercel deployment (because even dinosaurs need a reliable hosting platform). Just make sure you've got:

- Node.js 18.x or higher (no prehistoric versions allowed)
- Edge Runtime support (for those lightning-fast responses)
- Environment variables configured (your secret fossil collection)

## 🦕 Contributing

Want to join our pack? Follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository (like finding your own dig site)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-dino-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some Jurassic magic'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-dino-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request (let's review those fossils)
